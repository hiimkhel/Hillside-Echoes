                        <p class="align-left">Many individuals believe video games are merely a method for teenagers to squander their time, but certain games can genuinely enhance cognitive function.</p>
                        <p class="align-left">A prime example is BlockBlast, a mobile puzzle game that pushes players to think strategically. For adolescents, whose brains are still maturing, games like BlockBlast can aid in cognitive development. BlockBlast can assist in boosting focus, memory, and decision-making among teens.</p>
                        <p class="align-left">During adolescence, the brain continues to evolve. Improving cognitive skills is crucial for enhancing problem-solving abilities, concentration, and planning. When teenagers participate in activities that stimulate these skills, they can reinforce their cognitive capabilities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p class="align-left">Puzzle games, which necessitate strategy and critical thought, can serve as effective tools for this mental exercise. BlockBlast is a game in which players must arrange various shaped blocks into a grid, clearing complete rows or columns to accumulate points. As the game progresses and becomes more challenging, players are required to think ahead and carefully plan their moves. This transforms BlockBlast into more than just an entertaining game; it evolves into a cognitive workout. Engaging in the game can enhance spatial reasoning, working memory, and concentration—traits essential for achieving success in academics and daily life.</p>
                        <p class="align-left">In addition to its cognitive advantages, BlockBlast teaches players to make wiser decisions. With no option to undo previous moves, every action is significant.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p class="align-left">Teens learn to slow down, contemplate before taking action, and handle the results of their decisions. These competencies are valuable not only within the game but also in real-life scenarios such as studying, managing time, and resolving issues under stress. Developing such abilities can relate directly to everyday situations.</p>
                        <p class="align-left">Indeed, BlockBlast is a game that can support cognitive development in teenagers. While it’s essential to manage screen time and maintain balance, playing games like BlockBlast in moderation can actually help adolescents enhance their thinking skills. Instead of perceiving video games as unproductive, we should acknowledge their potential to facilitate learning in enjoyable and engaging ways.</p>

                            <p class="align-left">Living in a world that moves faster everyday, it's easy to overlook what's happening beneath the surface and mental health often tells a different story. </p>
                            <p class="align-left">In school, we learn about the heart, the lungs, different organs, and how our bodies work, but what about the brain and our emotions. Mental health affects how we think, feel, and act, yet it's often left out of the conversation. While physical health often receives significant attention, mental health struggles frequently, mainly hidden, stigmatized, and undertreated. For decades, mental health was misunderstood—often seen as weakness, or worse, ignored altogether. </p>
                            <p class="align-left">Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It influences how we think, feel, and act, affecting our ability to manage stress, build relationships, and make healthy choices. Conditions like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are not simply weaknesses; they are complex illnesses with biological, psychological, and social dimensions.</p>
                            <p class="align-left">According to the World Health Organization, over 970 million people worldwide live with a mental health disorder. That’s nearly 1 in 8 people. The consequences of untreated mental illness extend far beyond the individual. Untreated mental health conditions can strain family relationships,</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col">
                            <p class="align-left">Untreated mental health conditions can strain family relationships, impact productivity in the workplace or in school, and place a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide.</p>
                            <p class="align-left">Mental health encompasses more than just biological factors. Social contexts, trauma, genetics, and even dietary and sleep patterns contribute to it. This complexity also indicates that there are numerous methods to enhance mental health.</p>
                            <p class="align-left">Identifying the signs and symptoms of mental illness, such as ongoing sadness, anxiety, alterations in sleep habits, or withdrawal from social interactions, is a crucial first step. It is essential to seek assistance from a mental health professional, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor. Various effective treatments, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes, are available to help alleviate symptoms and enhance overall wellness.</p>
                            <p class="align-left">Creating a world where mental health is prioritized requires a collective effort. Education is vital for dispelling misconceptions and promoting awareness. Open conversations about mental health within families, schools, workplaces, and communities are essential to break down the stigma.</p>
                            <p class="align-left">By simply working together, we can create a world where mental well-being is valued, understood, and supported, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to thrive. </p>

                    <p class="section-text"> Human way of living changed drastically these past few years. Transportation, Electricity, Factories and growth in Industry. These activities may provide ease in life, still may potentially lead a disastrous outcome.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">A biggest concern that the planet is facing nowadays is the irregular changes in weather patterns that deviates differently from what is normally expected. This changes has been detected since the early 1950’s scientist has concluded that it will only progress because of human induced climate change and atmospheric vulnerability, the factors that contributes to this erratic weather conditions.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">The world is totally aware of global warming caused by the ruined ozone layer. Too much heat was absorbed by the Earth and less radiation was deflected. The extra heat radiation from the sun makes the day warmer especially on summer seasons. This extra heat waves also vaporize water faster building up stronger typhoons. The balance is broken since the day became hotter and the lesser the clouds covering the skies at night making the wind chiller.ccordingto World Meteorological Organization (WMO), there is 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed 2024 as the warmest temperature recorded.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">The heat wave past 2024 already felt like a steam on a boiling water and now it was predicted that this is not the peak.</p>

Precautionary measures in households are also crucial and need to be observed like utilizing mosquito nets, burning incense, wearing protective clothing to prevent mosquito bites and applying insect repellent is a necessity in keeping the mosquitos away.</p>

                        <p class="section-text">As the 2025 elections pass by, many young people, voting or not, have fought long to share the proper way of voting to others. The youth is the very structure of our nation. They are the ones who bring hope, the ones who fight for change in our nation’s politics. However, what happens when the people who are supposed to become the beacon of light for our nation, are also the ones who are being ignored?  </p>
                        <p class="section-text">The youth have so many fresh opinions and ideas, but are constantly being ignored. How many young people with great minds have been turned down all because of age and supposed inexperience? Age should not be a factor of how much someone knows. If the younger generation’s thoughts and opinions, especially on politics, fall on deaf ears, is it really going to help build an strong and equal country? </p>
                        <p class="section-text">  This leads to another problem – if the youth is constantly being ignored, they might feel like they are unimportant and become unmotivated to continue voicing out their opinions in order to reach more people. After all, why speak on a crowd where nobody seems to be listening?</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col">
                        <p class="section-text">Thankfully, however, this does not seem like the case for many young Filipino voters. Even way before the election, posts and comments are always being scattered on social media, informing others on the right way to vote. And it seems that whatever they are doing is working, as you couldn’y even go a second on social media without seeing a post about politics and who to vote for the election. The Filipino youth want change, and they want it now.</p>
                        <p class="section-text">Whether you like to admit it or not, the younger generation have a big impact on their country. Fortunately, as the years go by, the voices of the youth are slowly getting more recognized. As more of them speak up and stand up for what they think is right, more and more people realize and start to join in, craving a new and improved Philippines. Just like Dr. Jose Rizal said, “The youth is the hope of our nation”.</p>

                        What! The reasons for this may be lack of knowledge about sexuality and reproduction, which increases the risk of teenage pregnancy, 
                        limited access to healthcare services, substance abuse, and worse, the misuse of social media and technology, as well as getting swept

                <h4 class="section-author">By: Pauline Vilavicencio</h4>
                <div class="author-divider full"></div>

                 <div class="col">
                    <p class="smaller-text"> Education has been considered the key to a better future for long, especially in our country, the Philippines. Where young people carry the hopes of their families and communities. For Filipino youth, education is more than just an experience and requirement— it is a stepping stone to opportunities, self-confidence, and meaningful citizenship. However, behind those high rates of graduates is a quiet crisis that covers the image of every student on the stage.</p>
                    <p class="smaller-text"> This isn’t just a fundamental issue, this does not circulate in one neighborhood or one specific school. It runs in every vein of the country, and it hides in a plain sight.</p>
                    <p class="smaller-text">In 2021, the Philippines had a high literacy rate of 99.27 percent, which is a positive achievement. However, in 2022, the World Bank classified 90 percent of Filipino children aged 10 as learning poor, indicating their inability to read and understand a simple text by that age and most of them suffers in poverty which affects their opportunity to enter higher education. </p>
                    <p class="smaller-text">In fact, this crisis happens for a reason that students lack on motivation, prior knowledge, and access to learning resources. People struggles with literacy because of learning disabilities, having limited English and Filipino language skills, limited access to books, and a school’s ability to meet each student’s reading challenges. Some reasons is because the school’s curriculum in most schools is overcrowded, and basic literacy and numeracy may receive less focus as students progress past the primary years. Large classes, limited resources, and demands are the challenges that teachers have to deal with.</p>
                    <p class="smaller-text">I stand for the fact that literacy and numeracy should be treated as essential, lifelong skills and not boxes to be ticked in elementary school. Schools should employ teachers with great literacy and numeracy teaching methods and refocus the curriculum to prioritize literacy and numeracy mastery and lastly, lower the number of students per section to educate easily.</p>
                    <p class="smaller-text">Literacy and numeracy aren’t options for acquiring skills. They are the key for every other kind of learning and for participation in adult life. If schools can’t deliver them, everything else falls apart. It’s time to stop treating them like boxes to be ticked and start treating them like the priority they are.</p>

                        <p class="align-left">Press freedom in a democratic country is when the media is working freely to criticize and deliver the latest news to the community Philippines, a democratic country, but threats and harassments are prevalent towards the press Is this real press freedom? or is it supPRESSion? In pursuit of real press freedom in democracy journalists have been fighting for it for a long time. They risk their lives to give the people the information they need, but aside from the inherent risk in their job, they also face dangers that aren't always part of their job, but harassment and unlawful acts. According to the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibilities and the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines from 2022 to 2025, there were 48 cases of red-tagging 33 cases of harassment, ten received death threats and six were arrested. This shows that the press risks their lives just to give the community the news it deserves. This shows that the media is constantly facing suppression and the news that comes out is being controlled. These actions towards the press enlighten us about the lengths oppressors do to control the media Ig is importar to instill to the minds of the youth how the media is standing up for the truth and that they should also practice this behavior.</p>

                    <p class="align-left">As journalism. becomes part of the extracurricular activities of the students at school, it becomes a training ground for students to realize the reality that the press is facing. How standing up for the truth shows not only their courage but also implies that as citizens of a democratic country the truth would also mean that they are fighting for their rights With the constant pursuit of media freedom comes the setback of reality. Many people are now scared to become journalists and be a part of the press as the job comes with risks. According to the Commission on Higher Education, in 2024 only 40 universities across the country offer journalism programs. The course is seen by many to provide an unstable and dangerous job. According to Tamayo et al (2025) factors that contribute to the decline of journalists are the rising hostility towards the press and public skepticism to, the media As proper education for journalism is scarce the social media influencers and vloggers are milking the current issues by making "educational videos with little to no credible sources. While higher education currently face issues with journalism related courses. The practice of having a school press is crucial as it might promote and pique the interests of the youth who are into journalism.</p>

                    <p class="align-left">press is crucial as it might promote and pique the interests of the youth who are into journalism. By training students how to provide information in a credible way and the way journalists do it versus how influencers do it, it might curb the spread of fake news. This becomes a fight not only to the journalists but for the community who are the top priority. Publicus Asia (2025) revealed that online misinformation is eroding public trust in traditional news sources. This situation is quite alarming due to the undeniable fact that traditional media sources which have been delivering factual news since its establishment are doubted by the community that it serves. Online platforms can manipulate the information one receives since it heavily relies on algorithms that only focuses on the frequent engagements of the user. School level journalism teaches students the real deal of being a journalist.As the youth are now frequently engaging in online platforms why not teach them the lengths journalists go to deliver credible news. Although this might directly return the trust to traditional media sources but it would give them the skill of analyzing the news that they receive.</p>

Even such signs that indicate this illness seem to fail to reach the attention of the masses. Attention and concern are gravely needed to oppose this illness; ignorance will only bring nothing but failure to notice and help. Do not ignore. Care for them. Be concerned for them.

Depression is not a weakness; it shows that we need help. We human beings thrive in companionship and teamwork; going solo sounds cool until the burden becomes unbearable. People you love would rather see you cry on their shoulders than see you at your grave. Needing help is inevitable. Come to us, we can help.
